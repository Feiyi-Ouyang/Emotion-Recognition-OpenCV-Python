Summary:
The files in the folder train FisherFace and EigenFace models to classify emotions using OpenCV functions. The dataset and trained models are too large, so we only include the scripts training the models here:

- main1_KDEF.py: train the FisherFace and EigenFace model on the KDEF dataset.

- main1_google.py: train the FisherFace and EigenFace model on the Google image dataset.

- EmotionSetAnalyzer: enumerate through all possible combinations and select the set 2of emotions that is most recognizable.
