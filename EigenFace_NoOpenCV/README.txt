Summary:
The folder includes python implementations without openCV.
- main1_NoOpenCV.py: recoding the images from the KDEF dataset, stored in data.pkl.

- main2_NoOpenCV.py: select training and testing images, train the EigenFace model using the EigenFace class, and print the accuracies of five-fold cross validation.

How to run the code:
You may skip the main1_NoOpenCV.py which saved the organized dataset in data.pkl. Run the main2_NoOpenCV.py to check the accuracies.

Performance:
The EigenFace model we implemented ourselves achieved similar accuracies on the KDEF data set as the model in OpenCV.
